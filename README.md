âš¡ Fun fact: Java was originally called "Oak". It was named after an oak tree that stood outside the office of James Gosling, one of the original creators of Java. However, when it was discovered that the name "Oak" was already trademarked by Oak Technology, the team had to come up with a new name. After much brainstorming, they eventually settled on the name "Java", inspired by the love of coffee shared by many members of the development team. So, the programming language we know as Java today was named after a cup of coffee!
